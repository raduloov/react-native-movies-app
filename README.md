## Usage

There is no live demo for this app since I would need to upload it to the Play Store and App Store respectively.
If you would like to try it out for yourself, follow these steps:

- Clone or download this repo
- Run `yarn install` or `npm install` in your terminal
- You would need an Android emulator which you can see how to set up [here](https://developer.android.com/studio/run/managing-avds)
- If you are using a Mac, you can download Xcode and set up an iOS simulator
- Run `yarn run ios`, `yarn run android` or `npm run ios`, `npm run android` respectively
